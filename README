This is port of KEncFS to KDE Frameworks 5 and Qt 5

KEncFS is a gui frontend for encfs. With KEncFS you can easily create, mount, umount and delete your encrypted filesystem.

Use of KEncFS is very simple: to create a new encrypted filesystem you must create new or select two existent dirs, one directory to archive encrypted files and another directory to mount on the encrypted filesystem with encfs (a mountpoint). After this, you can select a conventional ID for your encrypted filesystem and then a password.

With KEncFS you can also manage your encrypted filesystem. You can browse, mount, umount, remove from list (not from disk) your encrypted filesystem, in easy way.
